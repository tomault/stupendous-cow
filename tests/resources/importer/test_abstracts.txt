#11999 [Poster] Fast deep reinforcement learning using online adjustments from the past
  Steven Hansen · Alexander Pritzel · Pablo Sprechmann · Andre Barreto · Charles Blundell
  We propose Ephemeral Value Adjusments (EVA): a means of allowing deep reinforcement learning agents...
  EVA shifts the value predicted by a neural network with an estimate of the value function...
  We show that EVA is performant on a demonstration task and Atari games.
